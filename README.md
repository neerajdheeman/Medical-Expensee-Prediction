# Medical Expense Prediction Model
This is a machine learning model that predicts medical expenses for individuals. The model is trained on a dataset that includes various factors that can impact an individual's medical expenses, such as age, gender, bmi, smoking status, and region.


## Requirements

The following packages must be installed in order to use this model:

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-Learn

Matplotlib

## Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate analysis

Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate analysis were done to find out correlation between different features of dataset.
## Feature engineering

Feature engineering was done on features of dataset. These Feature engineering techniques were applied to make the dataset such that Machine Learning algorithms can have a maximum accuracy in predicting the medical expenses.


## Data Sets
After successfull Feature engineering, a training data set and a testing data set were made.
Expenses column was separated from original dataset as it is to be predited.
## Predictive modelling
Different Predictive models were applied on the training data set to get maximum accuracy.
Such as Linear regression, random forest regression, gradient boosting regression.


## Accuracy of models
Accuracy of predictive models were carried out using r2 score.
And after that comparison of scores were carried out.
